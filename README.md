## üîß How It Works

This project is a **Flask** web application that uses **Selenium** in the background to control a headless Chrome browser. When you submit a contest name, the following happens:

1.  **Flask Backend**: Receives the request from the frontend.
2.  **Selenium Scraper**: Navigates through the leaderboard pages on HackerEarth, scraping the data from each row.
3.  **Data Parsing**: The raw data is parsed and structured into a clean format.
4.  **Render Results**: The data is sent back to the user's browser and displayed in an HTML table.
5.  **Download Request**: If you click the download button, the app re-scrapes the data and sends it back as a CSV file attachment.
